## Education
I've studied Electrical Engineering for about six years. I spent two years at San Juan College in 
Farmington, NM, two years at New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology in Socorro, NM, and two years
at University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, NM. I slowly discovered my passion was creating programs and
apps that I can use to enhance my life. So I attended a coding bootcamp in Albuquerque called DeepDive 
Coding Bootcamp where I studied how to make programs and apps like the pros.
